## 1. Purpose
The purpose of building this portfolio website was to present myself as a qualified developer/IT professional to prospective employers by demonstrating my personalities, sharing knowledge in computer science and showcasing my level of proficiency in programming languages all at once on the site.

## 2. Target audience

Although the portfolio website was mainly developed to target potential employers, it was used to tackle some stereotypes from the public and make stronger connections with them as well. By creating a place that I can manipulate however I would like, as one of the many tech professionals, I get to show the audience my multiple identities, and most importantly in a much more detailed and sophisticated way.

## 3. Functionality / Features
Inspired by past experience, the concept of minimalism in architecture and construction had been on my mind for how I would want the website to be developed aesthetically. 

In addition, since this was the very first step of my journey in the web/software development world, my strategy was to 'aim low' -- i.e., Only the most basic features (Site Navigation, Home Page, Self-Introduction, Blog and/or News, Contact Forms) would be included. 

Therefore, the two ideas above tied in with each other and the development process was basically revolving around them. Nevertheless, some subtle animated touches were added to the website's slightly dull and drab theme.

## 5. Tech stack 

The collection of techs for the portfolio website was merely HTML and CSS, and it would be deployed on the platform Netlify. 

## 6. Snippets

Below is a display of how parts of the web pages were rendered using CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS frameworkâ€™s styles with my own.
